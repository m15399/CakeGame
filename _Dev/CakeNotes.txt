when a dude eats cake, he turns into happy fixed block

different dudes have different properties:

hop 2 spaces 
hop every 2 moves - sleepy guy
skinny dude that eats 2 cakes
king - acts like a push block, must be pushed onto a cake to complete level
	has a crown, is fat and unable to move by himself
pressing up/down has effects even if no move happens

blocks:
spikes/lava must be hopped, lasers must be ghosted through
buttons, gates can be ghosted through, bridges 
side portals (loop around)

levels:
force to move up tutorial
force move past cake to get a cake on the other side, then come back up
levels where one special guy (eg ghost) has to save dudes one at a time
different themes for each world (skins of wall/sides/ground)

story:
told with simple animations between worlds - similar to pacman
each world has a different type of cake
1 - gardens
	wake up, jump out of bed, tummy grumbling, thinking of cake
	4 wide
2 - castle halls
	a few dudes see a castle with cake inside, cake! one says, they run in
	4 wide, add spikes, pushblocks, sword guys
x - dungeons
	find the king, he says he ate all his cake, his tummy grumbles, asks for cake
	5 wide, king levels (or buttons??)
width progression is close to 34567, but depends on story
